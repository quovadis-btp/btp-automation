btp contexts
=============

BTP contexts are a way of defining logical entities to host amd implement various contexts.  

The main idea behind is to break silos of global account, subaccounts across different regions and break free from 
the rigidity of the cloud foundry runtime org structure.

Having said that both cf and k8s runtimes can be used jointly or seperately in their respective runtime contexts
